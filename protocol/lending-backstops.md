# Lending Backstops

Bao Finance has integrated B.Protocol for automated, decentralized liquidations by the community.\


B.Protocol automatically facilitates liquidations on Bao using community deposits. This provides:

* Improved stability for Bao Vaults
* Higher capital efficiency
* Redistribution of profits to depositors
* Easier access to participating in liquidations

### How it Works

* Users deposit into Backstop pools on B.Protocol.
* Funds are automatically pulled from pools when Bao liquidations occur.
* Backstop AMM automatically handles the sale of seized collateral.
* Profits flow back into the pools.
* Depositors earn automated yield.

### Liquidations on Bao

* Risky debt positions are automatically repaid with B.Protocol deposits.
* Liquidation penalties convert into deposited assets.

B.Protocol enables efficient, automated decentralized liquidations to improve stability for Bao Finance.\
