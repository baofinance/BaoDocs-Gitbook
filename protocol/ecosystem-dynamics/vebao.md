# veBAO

Bao Finance uses a voting escrow system to align incentives and give governance powers to the community.

BAO holders can lock their tokens for up to 4 years to earn veBAO voting power. The longer the lock duration, the more veBAO they receive.

[veBAO](https://app.baofinance.io/vebao) has these properties:

* Voting Rights - Votes for governance proposals.
* Rewards Boosts - Up to 2.5x boost on BAO rewards on the platform
* Non-transferable - veBAO is a points system to represent how many BAO tokens you have locked and for how long.
  * 1 BAO locked for 4 years = 1 veBAO
  * 1 BAO locked for 3 years = 0.75 veBAO
  * 1 BAO locked for 2 years = 0.5 veBAO
  * 1 BAO locked for 1 year = 0.25 veBAO

veBAO holders can vote for the weighting of rewards distributed to liquidity pools. \
\
Every month, BAO purchased with revenue will be sent as incentives to BAO liquidity pools based on the weighting assigned by voters.\
