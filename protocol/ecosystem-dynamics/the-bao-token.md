# The BAO token

The BAO token is the centre of the Bao ecosystem. It was originally distributed as a fair launch to over 200 communities from November 2020 for 2 years. \
\
After the distribution phase was finished, BAOv2 was launched, with inflationary tokenomics to incentivise liquidity deposits on the Bao platform.\
\
The Bao community voted to fix the supply at 1.4 Billion tokens in December 2023 & instead incentivise liquidity on other platforms while using revenue to buy back BAO tokens and distribute them as incentives. \
\
The Bao team (guardians) receive around 0.8m BAO tokens each every quarter, which are staked for 4 years in veBAO, ensuring long term incentives are well aligned.&#x20;
