# Fees

### **Nest Fees** <a href="#sso6wp8haf2" id="sso6wp8haf2"></a>

Fees for using nests are separate and in addition to the fees collected when entering or exiting a farm.

Fees for the nests will be used for a combination of burning the governance token, adding to the treasury as well as a unique reflexive payment to current nDEFI holders as a way to incentivize long-term holding. This will be achieved by distributing â…“ of exit fees to anyone currently holding the nest token. The fees are broken down as follows:

**Entry fee 0.5%:** used to burn Polly tokens

**Annual streaming fee 1%:** accumulated by the treasury

**Exit fee 1%:** 0.66% accumulated by the treasury, 0.33% distributed to current nest holders

### **Farm Fees** <a href="#e3eg65j90nx" id="e3eg65j90nx"></a>

Fees for Polly farms will borrow the same structure as Panda and include:

* 0.75% deposit fee.

Fees are block-based and not based on timestamp. As Polygon has different[ average block time](https://polygonscan.com/chart/blocktime) lately, the time under each level of fee penalty may vary - the timespans are intended as a rough guideline.
