# Node based build/test

#### yarn

Yarn is a package manager designed as a replacement for npm, the default package manager for node based environments. It is faster, more secure and more robust.

Using yarn allows us to standardise scripts, etc. across all our development projects, even those that do not use node.

#### Hardhat

Hardhat does testing with node, so your test files can be either javascript or typescript.
