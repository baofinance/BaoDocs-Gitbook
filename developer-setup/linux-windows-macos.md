# Linux/Windows/MacOS?

Here we will describe what needs to be done to transform an off-the-shelf computer into one that can comfortably used for development.

## Linux

For Linux dev, we recommend using Ubuntu. See [https://ubuntu.com/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) for details.

If you don't already have it on your computer follow these instructions: [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview)

There's an option to install alongside or instead of your current version.

## Windows

Install WSL2

Or install Linux in a virtual machine system like Virtual Box

Or install Linux alongside, or instead of windows (break free, man!): See the description on Linux above.

## MacOs
