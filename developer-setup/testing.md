# Testing

## Why test?

erm. if it's not tested it doesn't work.

## Why write automated tests?

Automated tests, run by, e.g. forge test, allow future developers (incidentally including yourself) to know that any change they have made hasn't broken something else.

Ideally they should be run in a automatically against each commit to a github repo and even run automatically on your local git repo.&#x20;
