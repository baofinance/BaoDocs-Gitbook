# Developer Setup

## Assumptions

In this document we outline a basic set of tools and give instructions on how to install, setup and use. These are not the only tools that can be used and there are many instructions and references to many other tools, much of which no links are provided. In these cases we reply on you using search engines such as Google to find the relevant information.

This section will cover what is needed to get set up to develop Bao code on Ubuntu Linux (v22.04 at the time of writing)
