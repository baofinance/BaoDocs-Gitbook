# Pool Weights

The weight of each pool determines what proportional share of each block's Bao reward it gets.\
\
The standard base weight of 250 for ETH main net and 750 for xDai was used. Projects were scored higher or lower than that based on factors including liquidity, volatility and income potential.\
\
In the future, the Bao community will be able to vote on reallocating the weights
