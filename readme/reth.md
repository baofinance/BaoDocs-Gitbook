\
Since the Prisma risk report on rETH was carried out rETH, Rocket Pool has implemented the Houston upgrade, eliminating the team-controlled guardian role. \
\
The upgrade introduced a fully on-chain Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) known as the Protocol DAO (pDAO). This pDAO now manages the protocol, reducing reliance on third-party systems and eliminating the need for a centralized guardian​.

The pDAO controls protocol parameters, treasury funds, and security measures comprehensively. It features a new security council that can act swiftly to address any potential issues, ensuring a decentralized and robust governance structure.​
