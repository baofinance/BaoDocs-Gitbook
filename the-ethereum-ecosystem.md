# The Ethereum ecosystem

## Ethereum

There's no point in writing anything else as it's all in their docs:

## Solidity

The language (most) contracts are written in. Although for those fluent in so-called curly-bracket languages it may look familiar and you may think you can just skip this and pick it up as you go.

Not so.

The tie in with blockchain makes it quite different. Also the source code file itself will say what version of the compiler to use. Read the docs.
