# baoETH

The DeFi landscape has expanded rapidly, with new tokens and products emerging regularly to address existing challenges and unlock new opportunities. And now, with the introduction of baoETH, this token aims to revolutionize the ETH liquid staking space by providing a way to unlock the value of staked ETH tokens, utilizing bETH as collateral.

### baoETH: Overcollateralized ETH Pegged Synthetic Token

baoETH is an overcollateralized ETH-pegged synthetic token created by depositing ETH, bETH, or bSTBL as collateral into Bao Vaults. These tokens are pegged to the price of ETH and can be used for trading, leveraging, creating long positions, or providing liquidity in the baoETH/ETH gauge.

One of the primary use cases of baoETH is to allow users to unlock the value inside their bETH tokens with minimal liquidation risk while still retaining access to staking rewards. This feature is especially beneficial for users looking to leverage their staking rewards or take profits from crypto without losing access to their yield.

### Why baoETH?

baoETH offers numerous advantages to DeFi users, including:

* **Collateralization**: Utilizing bETH as collateral enables users to access liquidity without having to sell their bETH tokens, which are already diversified and mitigate risk.
* **Minimal Liquidation Risk**: baoETH's over-collateralization provides increased security and stability to the ecosystem by ensuring that a sufficient amount of collateral backs the token, reducing the risk of liquidation events.
* **Yield-bearing Opportunities**: baoETH offers lucrative yield-bearing opportunities for users, allowing them to earn passive income and rewards through staking and providing liquidity.

### Expanding the DeFi Market

The introduction of baoETH has the potential to expand the DeFi market by attracting new users and institutional users. The unique features and benefits of this token, including collateralization, minimal liquidation risk, and lucrative yield-bearing opportunities, make it an attractive option for both retail and institutional users.

As more users enter the DeFi space, the demand for innovative and secure products like baoETH will increase, further driving market expansion and fostering innovation in the ecosystem.

### Strengthening DeFi Infrastructure

As the DeFi ecosystem matures, the need for robust and secure infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. baoETH contributes to this goal by offering users an overcollateralized ETH-pegged synthetic token that is backed by a diversified basket of Ethereum-based LSDs through bETH.

The collateralization provided by bETH ensures that baoETH has a sufficient amount of backing, reducing the risk of liquidation events and enhancing the overall resilience of the DeFi space.
