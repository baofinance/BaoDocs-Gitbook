# Polly Finance Franchise

The ETF (Exchanged traded funds) industry has grown to over $6 trillion worldwide since it started 27 years ago. It makes up more than 15% of the estimated $95 trillion global stock market, which demonstrates the incredible market demand for diversified holdings that can be utilized for “set and forget” automated financial strategies.

‌The total market cap for the crypto markets today is around $2 trillion, and only $1 billion of that total is estimated to be related to crypto ETFs. At the market’s current size, this figure would need to reach $300 billion to be at the same level of saturation as traditional financial markets.

Polly Finance has an exciting opportunity to become a leading platform for the community and eventually anyone to create their own nests to manage diverse assets, purchase them easily, and automate their farming.

We plan to do this by curating ideas from the community to begin with, helping them to form strategies for picking tokens from leading projects, and putting them to work earning yield using proven methods. The end goal will be to open the platform up completely to allow anyone to create their own strategy, allowing you to comfortably invest in your preferred strategies with the confidence that your token is working hard for you.

Baskets are just one of the products we have planned and fall under the soft synthetics category - a token that represents a basket of underlying tokens. In the case of Polly Finance they will be branded as nests to stick with the parrot theme.
