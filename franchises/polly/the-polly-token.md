# The Polly Token

Polly is the governance token for Polly Finance, allowing you to vote on the composition of nests, strategies they will follow and the future direction of the project.\
\
In addition, to create a Nest, you have to burn an amount of Polly. As the burning process is complex for Polly, the automated recipe for nDEFI will buy and burn the right amount for you during the asset creation process. The amount of Polly to be burned is currently tied to the volume demand of your issuance order, but governance may vote to change this model.
