# bETH

bETH represents a basket of staked ETH tokens from various leading liquid staking providers. By pooling staked ETH tokens from different sources, bETH allows users to earn staking rewards without having to choose and diversify between staking providers individually. It is a low effort and low risk way to stake ETH while promoting diversity amongst staking providers.

The composition of underlying assets in the bETH basket is managed by veBAO holders, who adapt the portfolio to take advantage of the evolving liquid staking market. As a result, bETH holders don't need to monitor and assess options for staking continuously.

### Criteria for Inclusion

To be included in the bETH basket, a project must meet the following criteria:

* Have liquidity on the Ethereum mainnet, with at least one supported pool allowing a $1m buy with less than 2% slippage.
* Be operational for at least 3 months.
* Use Chainlink price feed.
* Offer wrapped tokens that compound staking rewards to minimize gas costs.
* Be non-custodial.

### Rebalancing

Rebalancing or altering selection criteria can be initiated at any time through a governance proposal by anyone.

### Fees

There will be no minting or redeeming fees. A 0.5% streaming fee will be collected, which is expected to be around 10% of the yield generated from ETH staking. The fees can also be adjusted at any time via governance.\
