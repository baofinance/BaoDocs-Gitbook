# Minting a Basket

{% hint style="info" %}
Minting adds a small % to the mint cost to avoid failed transactions. Usually a large portion of the uplift is returned to the users wallet because it is unused.

Before you mint a basket, check the premium to see if you can use less tokens swapping.&#x20;

* Make sure you are on [https://app.bao.finance/baskets](https://app.bao.finance/baskets) and your wallet is connected.
* Select the basket you wish to mint.

* Check the "premium" to see if you could get bSTBL tokens easier on an exchange.  A negative premium means swapping uses less tokens, but be aware of the liquidity available, and the impact your swap will make on your rate.\

* Enter the amount of basket tokens you would like to mint (or click the **max** button for the maximum amount). The amount of tokens that will be used is automatically updated. Remember, you are likely to have some returned to your wallet because of the markup to avoid failed transactions.\
