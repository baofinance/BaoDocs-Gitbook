The following instructions assume you have already [**Bridged Assets to xDAI**](bridge-assets-to-xdai.md)**,** and have [**xDAI for gas fees**](bridge-dai-to-xdai-for-gas-fees.md).

* Make sure you have Metamask connected to the xDAI network
  * You can tell the network when you click on the metamask extension. If **Ethereum Mainnet** is shown you need to change it to **xDAI**
  * If there is no xDAI option, you need to add it by following the instructions in [**Set Metamask up for xDAI**](set-metamask-up-for-xdai.md)****
