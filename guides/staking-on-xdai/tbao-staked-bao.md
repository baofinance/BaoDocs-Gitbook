# tBAO - Staked BAO

As new BAO products are released the community can vote to activate staking rewards for them, where some of the revenue will be used to buy back BAOcx and add them to the pool owned by tBAO holders. BaoSwap is currently the only product with fee sharing activated as of June 2021.\
\
Over time your tBAO will represent more BAOcx as they are added to the pool owned by tBAO holders. Your tBAO balance will not increase in size, the number of BAOcx each tBAO represents will as rewards are collected.\
\
There are no fees for staking or unstaking, so cannot lose BAOcx by taking part.
