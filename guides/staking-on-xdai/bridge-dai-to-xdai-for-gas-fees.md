# Obtaining xDAI for gas fees

Doing transactions on xDai network will require **xDai** for gas. xDai is a stable coin pegged to the USD dollar. Do not confuse with the **STAKE** Token which is the governance token for the xDai network.

There are several resources available to acquire xDai :

* Bridge DAI to/from xDai: [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/)
  * xDai have created some documentation here: [https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/bridges/converting-xdai-via-bridge/moving-dai-to-xdai](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/bridges/converting-xdai-via-bridge/moving-dai-to-xdai)
* Exchange USDT to/from xDai (via BitMax): [https://bitmax.io/en/basic/cashtrade-spottrading/usdt/xdai](https://bitmax.io/en/basic/cashtrade-spottrading/usdt/xdai)
* Buy xDai with fiat on the xDai network: [https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/get-xdai-tokens/buying-xdai-with-fiat](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/get-xdai-tokens/buying-xdai-with-fiat/ramp-network)
* Use the faucet to receive 0.01 xDai daily: [https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/faucet](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/faucet)
* Trade on BaoSwap (xDai chain) ([https://alpha.baoswap.xyz/#/swap](https://alpha.baoswap.xyz/#/swap))



Once you have some xDai, you are ready to [**Move Staked LP's to xDai**](migrate-staked-lps-to-xdai.md), or [**Bridge Assets to xDai**](bridge-assets-to-xdai.md) to add to BaoSwap, then stake.
