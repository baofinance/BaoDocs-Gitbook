# Bridge Assets to xDAI

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you click on the link to follow xDai's bridging instructions, take note of the bullet points below - They may come in handy.
{% endhint %}

The guide for bridging your tokens to xDAI can be found here: [https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/multi-token-extension/ui-to-transfer-tokens/transfer-erc20](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/multi-token-extension/ui-to-transfer-tokens/transfer-erc20)

* When you **unlock** the token you wish to transfer you can specify the amount of tokens to unlock or give unlimited approval. If you plan to bridge more at a later date it might be preferable to use an **Infinite Unlock**, to save gas in the future.&#x20;
  * Click **settings** in the top right
  * Flick the **Infinite Unlock** switch

* If you don't see a token, You may have to add it as a custom token. Select **Add Custom Token**, then paste the **Token Contract** address from [https://docs.bao.finance/contracts-and-key-info](https://docs.bao.finance/contracts-and-key-info) then **add token**.
