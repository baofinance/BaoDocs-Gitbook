# Obtaining BNB for Gas fees

Depending on how you are getting assets on BSC, there are a couple of options that may make sense for you :

* Use the Binance Bridge to swap some of an asset for BNB. You can find a guide for the Binance bridge [**here**](untitled.md#binance-bridge)****
* Buy BNB from [**Binance**](https://www.binance.com/en) or [**Binance US**](https://www.binance.us/en/home) and withdraw it to your wallet.
* Buy BNB from [any centralized markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binance-coin#markets) and withdraw it to your wallet.
