# Staking PNDA

When staking PNDA, you have 2 options. **** [**BAMBOO**](https://docs.bao.finance/franchises/panda/items-and-creatures/items#a1ba), our xSUSHI style staking product that uses some of the exchange fees to buy back PNDA from the market and distribute to BAMBOO holders. Over time each BAMBOO will be worth more and more PNDA as fees are distributed. \
\
[**RHINO** ](https://docs.bao.finance/franchises/panda/items-and-creatures/creatures#8766)is our experimental, high reward staking product that has quite severe penalties for unstaking and transferring to incentivise PNDA to stay staked. In return RHINO holders get a larger share of rewards.
