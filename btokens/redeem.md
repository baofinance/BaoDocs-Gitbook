# Redeem

The redeem function converts bTokens into the underlying asset and transfers them back to the user. The amount received equals the bTokens redeemed multiplied by the current exchange rate. Redemptions must be less than the user's account liquidity and market availability.

### bToken

```

* redeemTokens: Number of bTokens to redeem
* msg.sender: Address to transfer redeemed assets
* RETURN: 0 if success, error code otherwise

### Solidity
