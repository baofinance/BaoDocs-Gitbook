# BAO Improvement Proposal (BIP) Process

[BIPs](https://gov.bao.finance/c/concepts/7) are proposals by the community to improve or enhance the Bao Finance and ecosystem. They allow the community to evolve the project in a transparent, decentralized manner.

There are 4 stages to the BIP process:

### Stage 1: Concept Creation

This initial stage involves developing the idea and gathering feedback before drafting a formal BIP.

* **Idea Initiation** - Come up with a concept for a potential BIP.
* **Detailing** - Provide models, specifications, and other details to flesh out the initial idea.
* **Community Feedback** - Engage community to refine and improve the proposal.
* **Polling** - Use forum polls to gauge sentiment and support for the idea.

### Stage 2: Drafting the BIP

After a week in the Concepts section, a full BIP is drafted in the forum.

* **Transition** - Draft the complete BIP in the corresponding forum thread.
* **Feedback Loop** - Request review by mods and potential categorization.
* **Proposal Details** - Ensure the BIP has all necessary info for easy implementation.
* **Moderator Review** - BIP is moved to Governance Proposals and assigned a number if deemed comprehensive.

Moderators assess completeness, not agreement. Well-written BIPs fosters community confidence.

### Stage 3: Official BIP Listing

* **Moderator Approval** - Approved BIPs are listed for community review.
* **Snapshot Vote** - After a week, members can request progression to voting.

### Stage 4: Voting

* **Achieve Quorum** - Proposers promote BIP to achieve minimum 10m veBAO votes.
* **Decision** - If quorum unmet, multisig holders decide on BIP.
* **Veto** - Multisig can veto; forced revote if vetoed.

#### **Revote Criteria**

* Successful revote requires 2/3 majority.
* Must have 25% of total voting power.
* Veto reasoning provided with 1 week for rebuttal.

The 4 stages enable the productive, decentralized evolution of Bao Finance.
