# Treasury and Multisigs

**Framework**

1. **Budgetary Decisions:** Instead of micro-managing every expense, an overarching budget is sanctioned by the multisig, capped at 1/3 of annual treasury assets.
2. **Exceeding the Cap:** Expenditures surpassing this limit require a snapshot vote.
3. **Other Treasury Activities:** Rebalancing and similar actions just need multisig sign-off.
4. **Asset Restrictions:** The treasury is barred from using perpetual, futures, or options unless it's for reward farming through a neutral approach. This stipulation is immutable for future votes.
5. **Snapshot Voting:** The multisig will initiate official votes via Snapshot.
