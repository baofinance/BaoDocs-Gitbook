# Onboarding

We aim to be open to many members and contributors while providing support through onboarding. This ensures everyone is set up for success.

### How to Get Involved

Anyone can contribute to The BAO DAO by:

* Taking tasks from our public boards and communities
* Joining public channels to collaborate
* Applying to be coached in an area of interest

To apply:

1. Find our #apply-to-bao-dao channel
2. React to the galaxy fitting your skills and interests
3. Follow pinned instructions to submit an application

Our Galaxy Guardians review applications. You may need to complete trial tasks first. If accepted, you'll be onboarded as a Contributor.

### Contributor Rewards

There are no set rewards per task unless posted as a bounty. Each galaxy has a monthly budget to incentivize contributors who provide value. Rewards are given on an ad hoc basis.

### Application Outcomes

Applications may be denied if:

* Applicant doesn't align with our code of conduct
* Applicant lacks relevant experience
* Applicant has minimal time to contribute
* Applicant is inactive in our communities

Denied applicants can reapply after a month.

### Becoming a Guardian

After contributing for a period, members can propose promoting a Contributor to Guardian. Promotions require support from the Galaxy for harmonious collaboration.

New Guardians get a small grant and can negotiate ongoing pay based on expected contributions.
