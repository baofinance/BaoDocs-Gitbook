# Fees, Penalties & Funds

{% hint style="warning" %}
The penalty fee timer starts on your first deposit in a pool and resets when you unstake any amount of LP tokens from the pool.
{% endhint %}

All fees go into the treasury that backs BAO. The treasury funds are owned by the users who vote on their allocation and use, which can include the buying and burning of BAO.\
\
These fees only apply to LP assets and not to the harvesting of the BAO token.

For Panda fees, please head to [Panda franchise section](https://docs.bao.finance/franchises/panda/pandaswap-fees-penalties) as the below fees are related to BAO only

The fees are designed to be reasonable for users who want to temporarily yield farm, but penalize users who move out of the system rapidly.
