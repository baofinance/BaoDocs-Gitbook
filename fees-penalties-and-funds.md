### Liquidation Penalties

The liquidation penalty for all collaterals is 10%, or which 2.8% goes to the insurance fund and 7.2% goes to the liquidator.

If your health factor drops below 1, your collateral will be flagged for liquidation. This means anyone can repay your loan and collateral 1.1x the value of the repayment will be seized.
