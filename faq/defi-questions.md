### What are liquidity pools in DeFi and how do they work?

A liquidity pool is basically assets thrown together in a big digital pile. They are then used by decentralized exchanges to provide liquidity for traders. The balance of each asset within the pool determines its price. For example, a 50/50 pool with 1m Bao and 1 ETH, 1 BAO would cost 1 millionth of an ETH. In a 50/50 pool with 10 BAO and 1 ETH, 1 BAO would cost 0.1ETH.

### What is impermanent loss and how can it impact me?

Impermanent loss is the loss of value between holding assets you pool separately or as part of a pool.

If an asset decreases in price relative to the other, you are buying it on the way down, so lose more.
