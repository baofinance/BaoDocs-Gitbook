### What is BAO.cx / Is BAO.cx the same as BAO ?

When users migrate the $BAO token to xDAI over the bridge they receive a “$BAO on xDAI” token an ERC677 that is trustlessly controlled by the bridge contract.

This means that the Bao Farm on xDAI cannot issue its own “$BAO on xDAI” and will instead issue $BAO.cx (Bao coupon xDAI)

Rather than create a brand new contract just for swapping and worrying about security issues and audits, we will set up an incentivized $BAO.cx/$BAO on xDAI pool on BaoSwap that will allow users to swap between the two assets on the xDAI side. If they want to bring their Bao back onto ETH main net they will simply bring “$BAO on xDAI” back to the Omnibridge and switch back.

To provide the initial liquidity for this pool, the Bao treasury will allocate 2B Bao from the liquidity pool of the treasury (currently unused) to be migrated across and staked, and will do the same with the xDAI treasury when $BAO.cx farming starts.
